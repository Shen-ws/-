0,PlaneDepth: Self-Supervised Depth Estimation via Orthogonal Planes,CVPR,2023,"Ruoyu Wang, Zehao Yu, Shenghua Gao","Multiple near frontal-parallel planes based depth representation demonstrated impressive results in self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE). Whereas, such a representation would cause the discontinuity of the ground as it is perpendicular to the frontal-parallel planes, which is detrimental to the identification of drivable space in autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose the PlaneDepth, a novel orthogonal planes based presentation, including vertical planes and ground planes. PlaneDepth estimates the depth distribution using a Laplacian Mixture Model based on orthogonal planes for an input image. These planes are used to synthesize a reference view to provide the self-supervision signal. Further, we find that the widely used resizing and cropping data augmentation breaks the orthogonality assumptions, leading to inferior plane predictions. We address this problem by explicitly constructing the resizing cropping transformation to rectify the predefined planes and predicted camera pose. Moreover, we propose an augmented self-distillation loss supervised with a bilateral occlusion mask to boost the robustness of orthogonal planes representation for occlusions. Thanks to our orthogonal planes representation, we can extract the ground plane in an unsupervised manner, which is important for autonomous driving. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

1,OpenGait: Revisiting Gait Recognition Towards Better Practicality,CVPR,2023,"Chao Fan, Junhao Liang, Chuanfu Shen, Saihui Hou, Yongzhen Huang, Shiqi Yu","Gait recognition is one of the most critical long-distance identification technologies and increasingly gains popularity in both research and industry communities. Despite the significant progress made in indoor datasets, much evidence shows that gait recognition techniques perform poorly in the wild. More importantly, we also find that some conclusions drawn from indoor datasets cannot be generalized to real applications. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive benchmark study for better practicality rather than only a particular model for better performance. To this end, we first develop a flexible and efficient gait recognition codebase named OpenGait. Based on OpenGait, we deeply revisit the recent development of gait recognition by re-conducting the ablative experiments. Encouragingly,we detect some unperfect parts of certain prior woks, as well as new insights. Inspired by these discoveries, we develop a structurally simple, empirically powerful, and practically robust baseline model, GaitBase. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare GaitBase with many current gait recognition methods on multiple public datasets, and the results reflect that GaitBase achieves significantly strong performance in most cases regardless of indoor or outdoor situations.

2,An In-Depth Exploration of Person Re-Identification and Gait Recognition in Cloth-Changing Conditions,CVPR,2023,"Weijia Li, Saihui Hou, Chunjie Zhang, Chunshui Cao, Xu Liu, Yongzhen Huang, Yao Zhao","The target of person re-identification (ReID) and gait recognition is consistent, that is to match the target pedestrian under surveillance cameras. For the cloth-changing problem, video-based ReID is rarely studied due to the lack of a suitable cloth-changing benchmark, and gait recognition is often researched under controlled conditions. To tackle this problem, we propose a Cloth-Changing benchmark for Person re-identification and Gait recognition (CCPG). It is a cloth-changing dataset, and there are several highlights in CCPG, (1) it provides 200 identities and over 16K sequences are captured indoors and outdoors, (2) each identity has seven different cloth-changing statuses, which is hardly seen in previous datasets, (3) RGB and silhouettes version data are both available for research purposes. Moreover, aiming to investigate the cloth-changing problem systematically, comprehensive experiments are conducted on video-based ReID and gait recognition methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ReID and gait recognition separately in different cloth-changing conditions and suggest that gait recognition is a potential solution for addressing the cloth-changing problem.

3,Towards Modality-Agnostic Person Re-Identification With Descriptive Query,CVPR,2023,"Cuiqun Chen, Mang Ye, Ding Jiang","Person re-identification (ReID) with descriptive query (text or sketch) provides an important supplement for general image-image paradigms, which is usually studied in a single cross-modality matching manner, e.g., text-to-image or sketch-to-photo. However, without a camera-captured photo query, it is uncertain whether the text or sketch is available or not in practical scenarios. This motivates us to study a new and challenging modality-agnostic person re-identification problem. Towards this goal, we propose a unified person re-identification (UNIReID) architecture that can effectively adapt to cross-modality and multi-modality tasks. Specifically, UNIReID incorporates a simple dual-encoder with task-specific modality learning to mine and fuse visual and textual modality information. To deal with the imbalanced training problem of different tasks in UNIReID, we propose a task-aware dynamic training strategy in terms of task difficulty, adaptively adjusting the training focus. Besides, we construct three multi-modal ReID datasets by collecting the corresponding sketches from photos to support this challenging task. The experimental results on three multi-modal ReID datasets show that our UNIReID greatly improves the retrieval accuracy and generalization ability on different tasks and unseen scenarios.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Chen_Towards_Modality-Agnostic_Person_Re-Identification_With_Descriptive_Query_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
4,Visual Recognition-Driven Image Restoration for Multiple Degradation With Intrinsic Semantics Recovery,CVPR,2023,"Zizheng Yang, Jie Huang, Jiahao Chang, Man Zhou, Hu Yu, Jinghao Zhang, Feng Zhao","Deep image recognition models suffer a significant performance drop when applied to low-quality images since they are trained on high-quality images. Although many studies have investigated to solve the issue through image restoration or domain adaptation, the former focuses on visual quality rather than recognition quality, while the latter requires semantic annotations for task-specific training. In this paper, to address more practical scenarios, we propose a Visual Recognition-Driven Image Restoration network for multiple degradation, dubbed VRD-IR, to recover high-quality images from various unknown corruption types from the perspective of visual recognition within one model. Concretely, we harmonize the semantic representations of diverse degraded images into a unified space in a dynamic manner, and then optimize them towards intrinsic semantics recovery. Moreover, a prior-ascribing optimization strategy is introduced to encourage VRD-IR to couple with various downstream recognition tasks better. Our VRD-IR is corruption- and recognition-agnostic, and can be inserted into various recognition tasks directly as an image enhancement module. Extensive experiments on multiple image distortions demonstrate that our VRD-IR surpasses existing image restoration methods and show superior performance on diverse high-level tasks, including classification, detection, and person re-identification.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Yang_Visual_Recognition-Driven_Image_Restoration_for_Multiple_Degradation_With_Intrinsic_Semantics_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
5,Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification via Progressive Graph Matching and Alternate Learning,CVPR,2023,"Zesen Wu, Mang Ye","Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification is a challenging task due to the large modality gap and the unavailability of cross-modality correspondences. Cross-modality correspondences are very crucial to bridge the modality gap. Some existing works try to mine cross-modality correspondences, but they focus only on local information. They do not fully exploit the global relationship across identities, thus limiting the quality of the mined correspondences. Worse still, the number of clusters of the two modalities is often inconsistent, exacerbating the unreliability of the generated correspondences. In response, we devise a Progressive Graph Matching method to globally mine cross-modality correspondences under cluster imbalance scenarios. PGM formulates correspondences mining as a graph matching process and considers the global information by minimizing the global matching cost, where the matching cost measures the dissimilarity of clusters. Besides, PGM adopts a progressive strategy to address the imbalance issue with multiple dynamic matching processes. Based on PGM, we design an Alternate Cross Contrastive Learning (ACCL) module to reduce the modality gap with the mined cross-modality correspondences, while mitigating the effect of noise in correspondences through an alternate scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate the reliability of the generated correspondences and the effectiveness of our method.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wu_Unsupervised_Visible-Infrared_Person_Re-Identification_via_Progressive_Graph_Matching_and_Alternate_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
6,Clothing-Change Feature Augmentation for Person Re-Identification,CVPR,2023,"Ke Han, Shaogang Gong, Yan Huang, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan","Clothing-change person re-identification (CC Re-ID) aims to match the same person who changes clothes across cameras. Current methods are usually limited by the insufficient number and variation of clothing in training data, e.g. each person only has 2 outfits in the PRCC dataset. In this work, we propose a novel Clothing-Change Feature Augmentation (CCFA) model for CC Re-ID to largely expand clothing-change data in the feature space rather than visual image space. It automatically models the feature distribution expansion that reflects a person's clothing colour and texture variations to augment model training. Specifically, to formulate meaningful clothing variations in the feature space, our method first estimates a clothing-change normal distribution with intra-ID cross-clothing variances. Then an augmentation generator learns to follow the estimated distribution to augment plausible clothing-change features. The augmented features are guaranteed to maximise the change of clothing and minimise the change of identity properties by adversarial learning to assure the effectiveness. Such augmentation is performed iteratively with an ID-correlated augmentation strategy to increase intra-ID clothing variations and reduce inter-ID clothing variations, enforcing the Re-ID model to learn clothing-independent features inherently. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with state-of-the-art results on CC Re-ID datasets.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Han_Clothing-Change_Feature_Augmentation_for_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
7,Samples With Low Loss Curvature Improve Data Efficiency,CVPR,2023,"Isha Garg, Kaushik Roy","In this paper, we study the second order properties of the loss of trained deep neural networks with respect to the training data points to understand the curvature of the loss surface in the vicinity of these points. We find that there is an unexpected concentration of samples with very low curvature. We note that these low curvature samples are largely consistent across completely different architectures, and identifiable in the early epochs of training. We show that the curvature relates to the 'cleanliness' of the data points, with low curvatures samples corresponding to clean, higher clarity samples, representative of their category. Alternatively, high curvature samples are often occluded, have conflicting features and visually atypical of their category. Armed with this insight, we introduce SLo-Curves, a novel coreset identification and training algorithm. SLo-curves identifies the samples with low curvatures as being more data-efficient and trains on them with an additional regularizer that penalizes high curvature of the loss surface in their vicinity. We demonstrate the efficacy of SLo-Curves on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, where it outperforms state of the art coreset selection methods at small coreset sizes by up to 9%. The identified coresets generalize across architectures, and hence can be pre-computed to generate condensed versions of datasets for use in downstream tasks.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Garg_Samples_With_Low_Loss_Curvature_Improve_Data_Efficiency_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
8,Event-Guided Person Re-Identification via Sparse-Dense Complementary Learning,CVPR,2023,"Chengzhi Cao, Xueyang Fu, Hongjian Liu, Yukun Huang, Kunyu Wang, Jiebo Luo, Zheng-Jun Zha","Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) is a prominent computer vision topic due to its wide range of video surveillance applications. Most existing methods utilize spatial and temporal correlations in frame sequences to obtain discriminative person features. However, inevitable degradations, e.g., motion blur contained in frames often cause ambiguity texture noise and temporal disturbance, leading to the loss of identity-discriminating cues. Recently, a new bio-inspired sensor called event camera, which can asynchronously record intensity changes, brings new vitality to the Re-ID task. With the microsecond resolution and low latency, event cameras can accurately capture the movements of pedestrians even in the aforementioned degraded environments. Inspired by the properties of event cameras, in this work, we propose a Sparse-Dense Complementary Learning Framework, which effectively extracts identity features by fully exploiting the complementary information of dense frames and sparse events. Specifically, for frames, we build a CNN-based module to aggregate the dense features of pedestrian appearance step-by-step, while for event streams, we design a bio-inspired spiking neural backbone, which encodes event signals into sparse feature maps in a spiking form, to present the dynamic motion cues of pedestrians. Finally, a cross feature alignment module is constructed to complementarily fuse motion information from events and appearance cues from frames to enhance identity representation learning. Experiments on several benchmarks show that by employing events and SNN into Re-ID, our method significantly outperforms competitive methods.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Cao_Event-Guided_Person_Re-Identification_via_Sparse-Dense_Complementary_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1

In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation technique, dubbed PartMix, that synthesizes the augmented samples by mixing the part descriptors across the modalities to improve the performance of part-based VI-ReID models. Especially, we synthesize the positive and negative samples within the same and across different identities and regularize the backbone model through contrastive learning. In addition, we also present an entropy-based mining strategy to weaken the adverse impact of unreliable positive and negative samples.

10,UniHCP: A Unified Model for Human-Centric Perceptions,CVPR,2023,"Yuanzheng Ci, Yizhou Wang, Meilin Chen, Shixiang Tang, Lei Bai, Feng Zhu, Rui Zhao, Fengwei Yu, Donglian Qi, Wanli Ouyang","Human-centric perceptions (e.g., pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian detection, person re-identification, etc.) play a key role in industrial applications of visual models. While specific human-centric tasks have their own relevant semantic aspect to focus on, they also share the same underlying semantic structure of the human body. However, few works have attempted to exploit such homogeneity and design a general-propose model for human-centric tasks. In this work, we revisit a broad range of human-centric tasks and unify them in a minimalist manner. We propose UniHCP, a Unified Model for Human-Centric Perceptions, which unifies a wide range of human-centric tasks in a simplified end-to-end manner with the plain vision transformer architecture. With large-scale joint training on 33 humancentric datasets, UniHCP can outperform strong baselines on several in-domain and downstream tasks by direct evaluation. When adapted to a specific task, UniHCP achieves new SOTAs on a wide range of human-centric tasks, e.g., 69.8 mIoU on CIHP for human parsing, 86.18 mA on PA-100K for attribute prediction, 90.3 mAP on Market1501 for ReID, and 85.8 JI on CrowdHuman for pedestrian detection, performing better than specialized models tailored for each task.

11,StyleGene: Crossover and Mutation of Region-Level Facial Genes for Kinship Face Synthesis,CVPR,2023,"Hao Li, Xianxu Hou, Zepeng Huang, Linlin Shen","High-fidelity kinship face synthesis has many potential applications, such as kinship verification, missing child identification, and social media analysis. However, it is challenging to synthesize high-quality descendant faces with genetic relations due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated kinship data. This paper proposes RFG (Region-level Facial Gene) extraction framework to address this issue. We propose to use IGE (Image-based Gene Encoder), LGE (Latent-based Gene Encoder) and Gene Decoder to learn the RFGs of a given face image, and the relationships between RFGs and the latent space of StyleGAN2. As cycle-like losses are designed to measure the L_2 distances between the output of Gene Decoder and image encoder, and that between the output of LGE and IGE, only face images are required to train our framework, i.e. no paired kinship face data is required. Based upon the proposed RFGs, a crossover and mutation module is further designed to inherit the facial parts of parents. A Gene Pool has also been used to introduce the variations into the mutation of RFGs. The diversity of the faces of descendants can thus be significantly increased. Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective experiments on FIW, TSKinFace, and FF-Databases clearly show that the quality and diversity of kinship faces generated by our approach are much better than the existing state-of-the-art methods.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Li_StyleGene_Crossover_and_Mutation_of_Region-Level_Facial_Genes_for_Kinship_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
12,PHA: Patch-Wise High-Frequency Augmentation for Transformer-Based Person Re-Identification,CVPR,2023,"Guiwei Zhang, Yongfei Zhang, Tianyu Zhang, Bo Li, Shiliang Pu","Although recent studies empirically show that injecting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into Vision Transformers (ViTs) can improve the performance of person re-identification, the rationale behind it remains elusive. From a frequency perspective, we reveal that ViTs perform worse than CNNs in preserving key high-frequency components (e.g, clothes texture details) since high-frequency components are inevitably diluted by low-frequency ones due to the intrinsic Self-Attention within ViTs. To remedy such inadequacy of the ViT, we propose a Patch-wise High-frequency Augmentation (PHA) method with two core designs. First, to enhance the feature representation ability of high-frequency components, we split patches with high-frequency components by the Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform, then empower the ViT to take the split patches as auxiliary input. Second, to prevent high-frequency components from being diluted by low-frequency ones when taking the entire sequence as input during network optimization, we propose a novel patch-wise contrastive loss. From the view of gradient optimization, it acts as an implicit augmentation to improve the representation ability of key high-frequency components. This benefits the ViT to capture key high-frequency components to extract discriminative person representations. PHA is necessary during training and can be removed during inference, without bringing extra complexity. Extensive experiments on widely-used ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Zhang_PHA_Patch-Wise_High-Frequency_Augmentation_for_Transformer-Based_Person_Re-Identification_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
13,Beyond Appearance: A Semantic Controllable Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Human-Centric Visual Tasks,CVPR,2023,"Weihua Chen, Xianzhe Xu, Jian Jia, Hao Luo, Yaohua Wang, Fan Wang, Rong Jin, Xiuyu Sun","Human-centric visual tasks have attracted increasing research attention due to their widespread applications. In this paper, we aim to learn a general human representation from massive unlabeled human images which can benefit downstream human-centric tasks to the maximum extent. We call this method SOLIDER, a Semantic cOntrollable seLf-supervIseD lEaRning framework. Unlike the existing self-supervised learning methods, prior knowledge from human images is utilized in SOLIDER to build pseudo semantic labels and import more semantic information into the learned representation. Meanwhile, we note that different downstream tasks always require different ratios of semantic information and appearance information. For example, human parsing requires more semantic information, while person re-identification needs more appearance information for identification purpose. So a single learned representation cannot fit for all requirements. To solve this problem, SOLIDER introduces a conditional network with a semantic controller. After the model is trained, users can send values to the controller to produce representations with different ratios of semantic information, which can fit different needs of downstream tasks. Finally, SOLIDER is verified on six downstream human-centric visual tasks. It outperforms state of the arts and builds new baselines for these tasks.

14,Similarity Metric Learning for RGB-Infrared Group Re-Identification,CVPR,2023,"Jianghao Xiong, Jianhuang Lai","Group re-identification (G-ReID) aims to re-identify a group of people that is observed from non-overlapping camera systems. The existing literature has mainly addressed RGB-based problems, but RGB-infrared (RGB-IR) cross-modality matching problem has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a metric learning method Closest Permutation Matching (CPM) for RGB-IR G-ReID. We model each group as a set of single-person features which are extracted by MPANet, then we propose the metric Closest Permutation Distance (CPD) to measure the similarity between two sets of features. CPD is invariant with order changes of group members so that it solves the layout change problem in G-ReID. Furthermore, we introduce the problem of G-ReID without person labels. In the weak-supervised case, we design the Relation-aware Module (RAM) that exploits visual context and relations among group members to produce a modality-invariant order of features in each group, with which group member features within a set can be sorted to form a robust group representation against modality change. To support the study on RGB-IR G-ReID, we construct a new large-scale RGB-IR G-ReID dataset CM-Group. The dataset contains 15,440 RGB images and 15,506 infrared images of 427 groups and 1,013 identities.

Nevertheless, recent work has shown that these methods have limited utility in practice, presumably because they only highlight the most salient parts of an image (i.e., ""where"" the model looked) and do not communicate any information about ""what"" the model saw at those locations. In this work, we try to fill in this gap with Craft -- a novel approach to identify both ""what"" and ""where"" by generating concept-based explanations. We introduce 3 new ingredients to the automatic concept extraction literature: (i) a recursive strategy to detect and decompose concepts across layers, (ii) a novel method for a more faithful estimation of concept importance using Sobol indices, and (iii) the use of implicit differentiation to unlock Concept Attribution Maps. We conduct both human and computer vision experiments to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. We show that our recursive decomposition generates meaningful and accurate concepts and that the proposed concept importance estimation technique is more faithful to the model than previous methods. When evaluating the usefulness of the method for human experimenters on the utility benchmark, we find that our approach significantly improves on two of the three test scenarios (while none of the current methods including ours help on the third). Overall, our study suggests that, while much work remains toward the development of general explainability methods that are useful in practical scenarios, the identification of meaningful concepts at the proper level of granularity yields useful and complementary information beyond that afforded by attribution methods.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Fel_CRAFT_Concept_Recursive_Activation_FacTorization_for_Explainability_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1

Specifically, we analyze the effect of clothing on the model inference and adopt a dual-branch model to simulate causal intervention. Progressively, clothing bias is eliminated automatically with model training. AIM is encouraged to learn more discriminative ID clues that are free from clothing bias.

This provides both users and model developers an intuitive assessment of similarity and differences between GANs.

Moreover, an effective fine-grained dependency reconstruction module (FDR) is developed to discover substantial pattern dependencies shared in two modalities.

In so doing, the negative pairs can be identified despite their proximity, and we are able to utilize this information to significantly improve LP's ability to identify far-apart positive pairs and close negative pairs.

20,Jedi: Entropy-Based Localization and Removal of Adversarial Patches,CVPR,2023,"Bilel Tarchoun, Anouar Ben Khalifa, Mohamed Ali Mahjoub, Nael Abu-Ghazaleh, Ihsen Alouani","Real-world adversarial physical patches were recently shown to be successful in compromising state-of-the-art models in a variety of computer vision applications. The most promising defenses that are based on either input gradient or features analyses have been shown to be compromised by recent GAN-based adaptive attacks that generate realistic/naturalistic patches. In this paper, we propose Jedi, a new defense against adversarial patches that is resilient to realistic patch attacks, and also improves detection and recovery compared to the state of the art. Jedi leverages two new ideas: (1) it improves the identification of potential patch regions using entropy analysis: we show that the entropy of adversarial patches is high, even in naturalistic patches; and (2) it improves the localization of adversarial patches, using an autoencoder that is able to complete patch regions and filter out normal regions with high entropy that are not part of a patch. Jedi achieves high precision adversarial patch localization, which we show is critical to successfully repair the images. Since Jedi relies on an input entropy analysis, it is model-agnostic, and can be applied on pre-trained off-the-shelf models without changes to the training or inference of the protected models. Jedi detects on average 90% of adversarial patches across different benchmarks and recovers up to 94% of successful patch attacks (Compared to 75% and 65% for LGS and Jujutsu, respectively). Jedi is also able to continue detection even in the presence of adaptive realistic patches that are able to fool other defenses.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Tarchoun_Jedi_Entropy-Based_Localization_and_Removal_of_Adversarial_Patches_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
21,Diverse Embedding Expansion Network and Low-Light Cross-Modality Benchmark for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification,CVPR,2023,"Yukang Zhang, Hanzi Wang","For the visible-infrared person re-identification (VIReID) task, one of the major challenges is the modality gaps between visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) images. However, the training samples are usually limited, while the modality gaps are too large, which leads that the existing methods cannot effectively mine diverse cross-modality clues. To handle this limitation, we propose a novel augmentation network in the embedding space, called diverse embedding expansion network (DEEN). The proposed DEEN can effectively generate diverse embeddings to learn the informative feature representations and reduce the modality discrepancy between the VIS and IR images. Moreover, the VIReID model may be seriously affected by drastic illumination changes, while all the existing VIReID datasets are captured under sufficient illumination without significant light changes. Thus, we provide a low-light cross-modality (LLCM) dataset, which contains 46,767 bounding boxes of 1,064 identities captured by 9 RGB/IR cameras. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB and LLCM datasets show the superiority of the proposed DEEN over several other state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset are released at: https://github.com/ZYK100/LLCM",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Zhang_Diverse_Embedding_Expansion_Network_and_Low-Light_Cross-Modality_Benchmark_for_Visible-Infrared_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,https://github.com/ZYK100/LLCM,3,-1
22,Continuous Sign Language Recognition With Correlation Network,CVPR,2023,"Lianyu Hu, Liqing Gao, Zekang Liu, Wei Feng","Human body trajectories are a salient cue to identify actions in video. Such body trajectories are mainly conveyed by hands and face across consecutive frames in sign language. However, current methods in continuous sign language recognition(CSLR) usually process frames independently to capture frame-wise features, thus failing to capture cross-frame trajectories to effectively identify a sign. To handle this limitation, we propose correlation network (CorrNet) to explicitly leverage body trajectories across frames to identify signs. In specific, an identification module is first presented to emphasize informative regions in each frame that are beneficial in expressing a sign. A correlation module is then proposed to dynamically compute correlation maps between current frame and adjacent neighbors to capture cross-frame trajectories. As a result, the generated features are able to gain an overview of local temporal movements to identify a sign. Thanks to its special attention on body trajectories, CorrNet achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on four large-scale datasets, PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily, and CSL. A comprehensive comparison between CorrNet and previous spatial-temporal reasoning methods verifies its effectiveness. Visualizations are given to demonstrate the effects of CorrNet on emphasizing human body trajectories across adjacent frames.",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Hu_Continuous_Sign_Language_Recognition_With_Correlation_Network_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf,,3,-1
